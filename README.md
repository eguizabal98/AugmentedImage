# Augmented Reality Project

This project is an Android application that demonstrates the use of Augmented Reality (AR) with AR Core and SceneView. It allows users to interact with augmented images and 3D models in the real world through their device's camera.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android device with AR Core support
- Android Studio

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/augmented-reality-project.git

2. Open Android Studio and import the project by selecting the "Open an existing Android Studio project" option and choosing the cloned repository.

3. Connect your Android device to your computer and build the project to install the app on your device.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your Android device.

2. Point your device's camera at an augmented image target (e.g., a printed marker or QR code).

3. The app will detect the augmented image and overlay a 3D model on top of it. You can interact with the 3D model using gestures.

4. The app also supports playing videos on augmented image targets. Point your camera at an image with a video marker, and the app will play the associated video.

## Features

- Augmented image detection and rendering with 3D models.
- Augmented video playback on image targets.
- Interaction with 3D models using gestures.
